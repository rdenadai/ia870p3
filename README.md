## About

Morphological image processing, now a standard part of the imaging scientist's toolbox, can be applied to a wide range of industrial applications. Concentrating on applications, this book shows how to analyze a problem and then develop successful algorithms based on the analysis. The book is hands-on in a very real sense: readers can download a demonstration toolbox of techniques and images from the web so they can process the images according to examples in the text.

Here you can see the implementation, documentation and examples of the most functions described in the book

Here you can see how most of the images were generated with the real implementation using the IA870 Python Morphology Toolbox
